# ReactJS with Vaadin web components

A simple application that combines [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) 
from [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com). 

Using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co) to provide some sample data via a RESTful web service, this application
uses the Vaadin Grid component to provide an infinite scrolling list of people in Star Wars movies (only around
90 people paged at 10 items per page)
